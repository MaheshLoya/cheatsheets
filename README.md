# cheatsheets
A collection of homegrown cheatsheets for several tools that I use quite often, but not often enough to remember all the specifics for.
Please feel free to contribute any cool/useful/practical commands or new cheatsheets. The goal is to have a consolidated repository 
chuck full of easy to read cheatsheets. 

## Current cheatsheets
1. AWS CLI
2. VIM
3. IPTables
4. Docker
5. TCPDump
6. TMUX
7. RSync
8. Wireshark
9. GIT
10. NFDump
11. Encoding & Decoding
